Post\+G\+IS P\+L/pg\+S\+QL Add-\/ons -\/ Readme \href{http://github.com/pedrogit/postgisaddons}{\tt http\+://github.\+com/pedrogit/postgisaddons}

The Post\+G\+IS Add-\/ons attempt to gather, in a single .sql file, useful and generic user contributed P\+L/pg\+S\+QL functions and to provide a fast and Agile release cycle.

A quick description of every new function can be found at the beginning of the postgis\+\_\+addons.\+sql file. A detailed description precede each function definition.
